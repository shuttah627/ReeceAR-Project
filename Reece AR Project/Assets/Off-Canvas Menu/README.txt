Off-Canvas Menu
---------------

Hey, thanks for purchasing our Off-Canvas Menu package!

The Off-Canvas Menu package allows you to create beautiful, native looking, customizable mobile menus in minutes.

The menu reacts just like a native mobile menu, transitioning smoothly in and out of view and reacting to partial drags appropriately just as you would expect an off-canvas menu to in a real native mobile application.

With Off-Canvas Menu it's super easy to add your own menu headers, items and separators - and because it's built completely in uGUI it is extremely simple to add your own completely custom menu items as well.

If you have any issues, suggestions or comments please drop us an email at:

Cheers,
Tom @ Hivemindly
